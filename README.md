# TrafficSignRecognition using YOLOV5

In this project we have achieved the following:

<ul>
<li>Created custom Indian Traffic Sign and Signal Dataset with over 4100 images.</li>
<li>Worked with YOLO processing and model training on custom dataset.</li>
<li>Integrated model with frontend using Flask API with a basic frontend.</li>
<li>Generated instructions for the input frame after processing the image.</li>
<li>Video Processing integrated with the model.</li>
<li>Achieved an overall mean Average Precision (mAP) of the model is 80.7% after running on 180 epochs.</li>
</ul>
